# GCP Key features

## Zones

GCP have 20+ zones around the world.
Each zone have al least 3 zones connected with low-latency links. Each zone has one or more discrete clusters.
- Region and zone utilization is based on latency, HW requirements, availability, regulations and cost.
- Instances runs in a Region, but images and templates (unless uses zonal machines) are global. 

----

## GCloud CLI 

- gcloud is part of Google Cloud SDK (requires Python) you can install it on your computer.
- Cloud Shell is a online shell, it has installed gcloud.
- Some GCP services have CLI tools such as BigQuery (bq), Cloud BigTable (cbt), Cloud Storage (gsutil) and Kubernetes (kubectl).

The general structure of a command is as follows:
  - ```gcloud GROUP SUBGROUP ACTION ```

### Configuration

  - ```gcloud --version ```
  - ```gcloud init ```
  - ```gcloud config list ```
  - ```gcloud config list account ```
  - ```gcloud config list compute/zone```
  - ```gcloud config configurations list ```
  - ```gcloud config set project NAME ```
  - ```gcloud config configurations active NAME ```
  - ```gcloud config configurations create NAME ```

## Managed Services in Google Cloud


| Service | Details | Category|
| :------- | :--------| :-------:|
| Compute Engine|High performance and general purpose VM that can scale globally| IaaS |
|Google Kubernetes Engine|Orchestrate containerized microservices on Kubernetes. Needs advanced **cluster configuration and monitoring**| CaaS|
|App Engine|Enables highly scalable applications on "fully managed platform" | PaaS (CaaS Serverless)|
|Cloud Functions |Build event driven applications using simple, single-purpose functions| FaaS Serverless|
|Cloud Run |Highly scalable containerized applications.  **Does not need a cluster**| CaaS (Serverless)|

## Compute Engine (Virtual Machines)

Google Compute Engine is a SERVICE to manage and create lifecycle of VM.
- You cannot  change a instance template, you can copy it and modify the copy.
- Custom images can be used to create vm-instances with OS patches and/or software preinstalled.
- You can share an image across projects.
- **Hardening** an image is the process of creating an image from a vm-instance that meets the security requirements of an enterprise.
- It is preferred to use a custom image rather than startup scripts.
- For vCPUs/ memory changes, a VM instance has to be stopped.
- A good practice is use labels to organize VMs.
- Management:
  - Default metrics: CPU, Network and Disk Throughput.
  - Cloud agent: Memory Utilization and Disk space.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :------- |  :-------|
|More flexibility | More responsibility ( Availability, installing software, choosing hardware and images)|

### Cost 

In GCP you are billed per second.  For money saving, always choose the right machine type for your needs and image for your workload. Whenever you have a predictable resources need, you can commit the use of a VM (Kubernetes or  Compute engine) for 1 or 3 years and get up to 70% of discount.
- **Preemptible VM** only last **24 hours**  or less due to system demands and they are 80% more cheaper but have a lot of disadvantages, e.g. not always available.
- Also, Preemptible VM doesn't work with free tier credits.
- The updated version of Preemptible VM is **Spot VM** and the key difference is that they **don't  have a maximum runtime**.
- Spot VM has a Dynamic pricing which represents 60-90% of discount to on-demand VM. 
- When you apart an static ip address you'll be billed, even if you aren't using it!
- The storage attached to a compute instance generate a bill. even if the compute instance is stopped. 
- Solutions to those problems are: Remove any static ip address that is not used and create budget alerts.
- A budget can send you email alerts about the limits of your budget.

### Live migration 

Whenever you need a system update (HW or SW) you can use Live migration. This means that your running instance is migrated to another host on the same zone. Also, this process doesn't change any attributes or properties of the VM.
- Preemptible instances doesn't support this feature.
- The way to configure the Live Migration is through Availability Policy section.

### GPU

- You can customize your VM with a GPU or use the predefined family of VM with GPU.
- You can add GPU to your machine but you have to use images with GPU libraries and supported machine types (shared core and memory-optimized machines does not support this feature).
- Adding GPU imply that VM won't support Live migration.
- GPU carry higher cost, but is useful for High performance, math and graphics intensive.

### Instances

  - ```gcloud compute instances create NAME ```
  - ```gcloud compute instances describe NAME ```
  - ```gcloud compute instances delete NAME ```
  - ```gcloud compute machine-types list ```
  - ```gcloud compute machine-types list --filter "zone:NAME"``` 
  - ```gcloud compute zones list --filter "region:(us-west2 us-west1)"```
  - ```gcloud compute zones list --filter region:us-west1 --sort-by ~name (~ means reverse order) ```
  - ```gcloud compute instances create my-test-vm --source-instance-template=NAME ```

### Instances group

Instances groups can be: 
- **Managed** (MIG) Identical instances autoscaling, auto-healing, etc compatible. Also you can use:  
  - Rolling updates (step by step updates)
  - Canary deployment (test newer versions on a group of instances)

- **Unmanaged** (UIG) different type instances not compatible with autoscaling, auto-healing, etc.

### Some scenarios and solutions

| Scenario | Solution |
| :------- | :--------|
| MIG managed  application that survives ZONAL failures | Create multiple zones MIG. |
| Group of multiple VMs with different configurations | Create an UIG. |
|Preserve state in a MIG (like databases)| Create stateful MIG. |
|High availability in MIG when there are hw or sw updates| Create a template with Availability police for automatic restart = on and on-host maintenance = migrate VM instance. |
| Remove unhealthy instances automatically | Create a MIG with auto-healing properly configured|
|Avoid scale up and downs|Cool down period (initial delay)| 

### Cloud Load balancing 

Enables: High availability, Auto Scaling and Resiliency.
Most common protocols such as:
- Network layer: Internet Protocol (IP)
- Transport layer: TCP, TLS (Secure version of TCP) , UDP 
- Application layer: HTTP, SMTP (email), FTP etc

### Terminology in google cloud balancing

- **Backend** refers to a group of endpoints that receives traffic from the load balancer

- **Frontend** specify an IPÂ and protocol

- **Host and path rules** defines the rules for redirecting traffic to different backends based on:

  - Path
  - Host 
  - HTTP headers

### Scenarios

| Scenario | Solution |
| :------- | :--------|
| Only healthy instances can receive traffic| Use health check |
|High availability for instances| Use a MIG  across different regions and configure a Load balancer.|
|Route request to multiple microservices with the same Load balancer| Configure the "The host and path rules" to redirect to specific  microservice depending on the path|
|Load balance Global external HTPPS traffic across backend instances, and multiple regions| Global external HTTP(S) Load balancer|
|SSL termination for Global non-HTTPS traffic with Load balancing| SSL Proxy Load Balancer |

### Instance-groups

 - ```gcloud compute instance-groups list```
 - ```gcloud compute instance-groups managed list```
 - ```gcloud compute instance-groups managed create NAME --zone ZONE --template TEMPLATE --size SIZE_NUMBER```
 - ```gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling NAME --zone=INSTANCE_ZONE --max-num-replicas=NUM_REPLICAS```
 - ```gcloud compute instance-groups managed delete-autoscaling NAME --zone=INSTANCE_ZONE```
 - ```gcloud compute instance-groups managed recreate-instances GROUP_NAME --instances=INSTANCE_NAME```
 - ```gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-instance-template GROUP_NAME --template=NEW_TEMPLATE_NAME```
 - ```gcloud compute instance-groups managed resize GROUP_NAME --size=SIZE```

 After some update you can manage the new release without downtime:
 - ```gcloud compute instance-groups managed rolling action restart GROUP_NAME ```
 - ```gcloud compute instance-groups managed rolling action replace GROUP_NAME ```
-----
## App Engine 
Is a service in Google cloud since 2008 which provides end to end application management. You pay for resources provisioned.
Some of the features that supports:
- Java, Go, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby preconfigured runtimes. 
- Use custom runtime and write in any language
- Connect to variety of Google Cloud storage products like Cloud SQL
- Automatic load balancing and auto-scaling
- Managed platform updates and application health monitoring
- Supports traffic splitting 

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :------- |  :-------|
| Lesser responsibility | Lower flexibility ( Cannot add GPU)|

### Environments

App engine provides two different environments: **Standard** and **Flexible**.

- In **Standard** environment applications runs in __language specific sandboxes__ and two versions. It does not support some runtimes like C++ (.NET).
  - In the V1 (old versions) Python and PHP runtimes have some additional restrictions with network and libraries.
  - In the V2 (new versions) there are not restrictions.

- In **Flexible** environment  applications runs in Docker containers which uses Docker Engine __virtual machines__ and support any runtime. Also provides access to background processes and local disks.

Here it is a simple comparison:

| Feature | Standard | Flexible |
| :------- |  :-------| :---------|
| Pricing | Instance hours| vCPU, Memory and persistent disk |
|Scaling| Manual, **Basic** (Instances are created when request are received) and Automatic (continuously running workloads)| Manual and Automatic|
| Scaling to zero|Yes |No (Minimum one instance)|
| Instance startup time| **Seconds**| Minutes|
|Rapid scaling (up and down) | **Yes**| No|
|Max. request timeout | 1-10 minutes | **60 minutes** |
|Local disk (storage) | Mostly except for Python and PHP. Can write to /tmp | Yes, ephemeral. New disk every startup |
|SSH for debugging| No |**Yes**|

### Request routing

Routing URLs have the following structure:
 - __default__ https://PROJECT_ID.REGION.appspot.com 
 - __specific service__ https://SERVICE-dot-PROJECT_ID.appspot.com 
 - __specific version of service__ https://VERSION-dot-SERVICE-dot-PROJECT_ID.REGION.appspot.com
 

### Commands

```gcloud app services list```
```gcloud app versions list```
```gcloud app instances list```

To create type 

```gcloud app create --region=REGION```

After a change in the app you must run

```gcloud app deploy (--version-NUMBER)```

To use other filename of yaml use: 

```gcloud app deploy app.yaml```

After the new deploy the old version still running, you can check the URL in: 

```gcloud app browse --version="NUMBER"```'
```gcloud app browse --service=NAME --version="NUMBER"```

After a change you can test your new version without launching it in the main URL with:

```gcloud app deploy --version-NUMBER --no-promote ```

And find the new version using the browse option described earlier. Also you can open the Console dashboard with the following command:

```gcloud app open-console --version=VERSION```

### Traffic splitting 

```gcloud app services set-traffic --split-by=OPTION ```
- __Based on IP__: Accuracy issues because IP change, also the request from a single VPN IP cause to request go to the same version.
- __Based on Cookies__: Cookies can be controlled from application.
- __Random__: Splitting randomly.

To split traffic **by IP** between versions use:

```gcloud app servicer --set-traffic --splits=vNUMBER=.5,vNUMBER=.5```

To split it by **random** use:

```gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=v3=.5,v2=.5 --split-by=random```

### Deploy an application without downtime 
- Option 1: Deploy and shift at once with ```gcloud app deploy```
- Option 2: Deploy with no promote  ```gcloud app deploy --no-promote``` and then shift traffic to second version with:
  - All at once ```gcloud app services set-traffic SERVICE --splits V2=1```
  - Gradually with migrate (not supported in flexible) ```--migrate```
  - Manually with ```gcloud app services set-traffic SERVICE --splits=v2=.5,v1=.5```
